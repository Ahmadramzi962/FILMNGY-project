    <h2>What is frontlight photography? </h2>
    <p class="description">
        In photography, front light is a type of lighting that places the main

<h2>What is backlight photography?</h2>

<h3>Backlight photography :</h3>
<p class="description">
    For all of the technical terms littered throughout filmmaking,
    backlight photography does what the name suggests:
    it positions a light source behind an actor or subject.
    This results in a classy, unmistakable rim of light around the subject.
    It can be as extreme as a silhouette, or mild as an outline, and is used everywhere from TV to theater,
    concerts to blockbusters.
   </p>

    <p class="description">
    The light is often positioned higher than the subject,
    providing depth and focusing on shapes. 
    Backlight photography is a core part of the three-point lighting set-up
    — and adds a dose of drama to your compositions and footage.
    </p>

<h2>Why do filmmakers use backlight photography?</h2>
   <p class="description">
    Shooting with backlight for videos and photos is amazing, isn’t it?
    It’s not a skill you can pick up from day one, and it doesn’t work for every single shot.
    But when used skillfully, backlighting can cast a frame in a whole new light.
