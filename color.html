    <h2> Colour Theory:</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Colour theory is the study of how colours interact with one another and how they can be used to create harmonious and visually appealing compositions.
      In photography, using colour theory involves understanding the different colours on the colour wheel, as well as their relationships to one another, in order to take better photographs.
      There are three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow), three secondary colors (green, orange, and purple), and six tertiary colors (such as red-orange, blue-green, etc.). Understanding the RGB colour model, the colour wheel, and the relationships between colours can help you create harmonious and balanced compositions.

   <h2>RBG colour model</h2>
   <p class="description">
    Before you look at a colour wheel, it's a good idea to get to familiarise yourself with the RGB colour model.
   </p>

    <p class="description">
    The RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colour model is an additive colour model used in digital displays and imaging devices. It defines colours by combining varying intensities of red, green, and blue light.

    Each colour channel can have values ranging from 0 to 255, representing the intensity of that particular colour. By blending different intensities of these three primary colours, a wide range of colours can be achieved. This model forms the basis for colour representation in digital images, computer screens, and other electronic devices.

<h2>Colour Theory in your photography</h2>
<p class="description">
    Here are some tips for using colour in your photography:
<br><br>
    1. Using complementary colours can create a sense of contrast and visual interest in your images.
    <br><br>
    2. Monochromatic compositions use variations of a single colour to create a harmonious and unified image.
    <br><br>
    3. Colour harmony refers to the use of colors that are pleasing to the eye and create a sense of balance and unity in an image. Different colour schemes create harmony in different ways, giving you plenty of room to experiment and get creative.
    <br><br>
   4. Colour temperature refers to the warmth or coolness of a colour. Warm colors, such as red and orange, are associated with energy and excitement, while cool colors, such as blue and green, are associated with calm and relaxation.
